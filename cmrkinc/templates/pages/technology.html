          <div class="cta-title subtitle">Our flagship product – Oleo Binder – is a proprietary, food safe bio-polymer. This biopolymer, in conjunction with the patent pending Oleo Process, allows for efficient micro-encapsulation of cannabinoids.  Our process creates a very fine (10-micron avg.), flavor neutral, cold water-soluble powder. We partner with manufacturers to provide Oleo Binder and specialized equipment required to conduct the Oleo Process on their cannabinoid extracts. The resulting infused powder enables scalable production and streamlined product development.</div>

          <div class="cta-title subtitle">Consider the products you might find at your local grocery store that use powders in the manufacturing process. They could be anything from drink mixes and sugars, to candies, baked goods, and seasonings. By using our infused powder, manufacturers can incorporate cannabinoid extracts into any recipe as easily as adding a scoop of flour. The infused powder is manufacturing-ready and has increased bioavailability due to particle size and water solubility.<br><br>
          Whether you have an old family recipe, an original of your own, or would like to collaborate to develop the product you've been dreaming of, we have solution for you.</div>

                <p>If you are unfamiliar with the problems many edible manufacturers face today then ponder the following scenario. Imagine you want to bake infused brownies. The extract you need to add to the brownies has a consistency similar to tree-sap; could you mix in tree-sap with the dry ingredients of your brownies easily? Conventional wisdom would have edible manufacturers dissolve the extract into a fat/oil. Edible manufacturers using that method have no option other than to tediously dose products and struggle to achieve consistency and accurate dosing.

              <div class="process-tab-col-right w-col w-col-6">
                <p>Infused powder is water-soluble. This means that it will readily dissolve in water. When using conventional extracts a edible manufacturer typically must first dissolve the extract into something such as fat or propylene glycol. Using our water-soluble infused powder allows edible manufacturers to readily tap into the powder drink mix market as well as many others. Water-soluble foods are easier for your body to digest.

                <p>Imagine that tree-sap extract once again. If you wanted to weigh out exactly 1mg of the tree-sap on a scale do you think you could do it? How long would it take if you could? Trying to add or remove 1mg of anything can be difficult, and nearly impossible with something that sticks to itself like tree-sap.<br>
                Now imagine you want to weigh out 1mg of our infused powder. You’d be able to remove 1 tiny grain of powder at a time, and you’d know exactly what the dosing will be if you remove that grain.

                <p>Bioavailability is how much of a compound your body can make use of at a given dose. Conventional edibles when taken orally have a bioavailability of about 20%. This means if you consume 100mg your body can only process 20mg (20% of 100mg) of the total 100mg. There are two main factors to focus on when trying to increase the bioavailability of something. The first is solubility of the drug which we discussed previously, and the other is the size of each particle. Our infused powder uses near sub-micron particle sizes. For perspective a single grain of sugar is approximately 100 microns, and a red blood cell is approximately 5 microns.<br>
                The advantages of this decrease in particle size means the end consumer will feel the effects quicker. This is because the bioavailability has been increased.

                <p>Currently most edible manufacturers have to either re-purpose odd food-processing equipment or have custom equipment designed for their specific use. There is not much existing equipment infrastructure in the food industries that deal with processing a tree-sap like substance.<br>
                Using our infused powder you can take advantage of the vast equipment infrastructure that is used to process powders in the food industry. No need to spend large amounts of your capital on complex &amp; specialized equipment.

                <p>Currently in edible manufacturing it can be a big liability to not have trained food scientists, and/or chemists on staff. This is understandable – blending oils to the right ratio, and a deep understanding of science are needed to accurately incorporate a tree-sap like extract into regular food.<br>
                Using our infused powder you now only need a staff skilled enough to work in a kitchen. There is no need for such a high paid staff.
