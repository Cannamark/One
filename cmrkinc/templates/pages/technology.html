          Our flag-ship product – “The Oleo Binder” is our exciting new proprietary food-safe polymer. CMRK Inc. makes, and sells The Oleo Binder to a select few wholesale processors that use our patent pending process. When The Oleo Binder is used in tangent with our patent pending infusion process, filed in November 2014, our patent pending process allows industry processors and infusers to streamline product development and production in ways previously thought impossible. The process uses a proprietary mixture of natural carbohydrates to trap individual molecules of THC into a matrix forming the powdered THC which can then be incorporated into just about anything.<br><br>
          As a client of Cannamark, our knowledgeable staff will help your company implement our process, and be here to help you along the way.</div>

          <div class="cta-title subtitle">Take a moment to think about the products you would find at your local grocery store that use a powder in the manufacturing process. You would find a variety of drink mixes, sugars, candies, baked goods, seasonings, and much more. By using our Infused Powder you can incorporate extracts into any recipe as easily as adding a scoop of flour. The Infused Powder is a water-soluble, and free-flowing powder that can be incorporated into any recipe. Whether you have an old family recipe, an original recipe of your own, or would like to collaborate to develop the product you've been dreaming of, we have solution for you.<br><br>
          Infused Powder is manufactured by licensed CMRK Inc. subsidiaries. We currently have subsidiaries found in Washington and California. Made using oil extracts and our proprietary co-polymer, the infusion process is accomplished using our patent pending process. Once the Infused Powder is made it is wholesale distributed to edible manufacturers within their respective states. Edible manufacturers that use infused powder streamline product development, efficiency, automation, and company growth.</div>

                <p>If you are unfamiliar with the problems many edible manufacturers face today then ponder the following scenario. Imagine you want to bake infused brownies. The extract you need to add to the brownies has a consistency similar to tree-sap; could you mix in tree-sap with the dry ingredients of your brownies easily?.. Conventional wisdom would have edible manufacturers dissolve the extract into a fat/oil. Edible manufacturers using that method have no option other than to tediously dose products and struggle to achieve consistency and accurate dosing.

              <div class="process-tab-col-right w-col w-col-6">
                <p>Infused Powder is water-soluble. This means that it will readily dissolve in water. When using conventional extracts a edible manufacturer typically must first dissolve the extract into something such as fat or propylene glycol. Using our water-soluble infused powder allows edible manufacturers to readily tap into the powder drink mix market as well as many others. Water-soluble foods are easier for your body to digest.

                <p>Imagine that tree-sap extract once again. If you wanted to weigh out exactly 1mg of the tree-sap on a scale do you think you could do it? How long would it take if you could? Trying to add or remove 1mg of anything can be difficult, and nearly impossible with something that sticks to itself like tree-sap.<br>
                Now imagine you want to weigh out 1mg of our Infused Powder. You’d be able to remove 1 tiny grain of powder at a time, and you’d know exactly what the dosing will be if you remove that grain.

                <p>Bioavailability is how much of a compound your body can make use of at a given dose. Conventional edibles when taken orally have a bioavailability of about 20%. This means if you consume 100mg your body can only process 20mg (20% of 100mg) of the total 100mg. There are two main factors to focus on when trying to increase the bioavailability of something. The first is solubility of the drug which we discussed previously, and the other is the size of each particle. Our Infused Powder uses near sub-micron particle sizes. For perspective a single grain of sugar is approximately 100 microns, and a red blood cell is approximately 5 microns.<br>
                The advantages of this decrease in particle size means the end consumer will feel the effects quicker. This is because the bioavailability has been increased.

                <p>Currently most edible manufacturers have to either re-purpose odd food-processing equipment or have custom equipment designed for their specific use. There is not much existing equipment infrastructure in the food industries that deal with processing a tree-sap like substance.<br>
                Using our Infused Powder you can take advantage of the vast equipment infrastructure that is used to process powders in the food industry. No need to spend large amounts of your capital on complex & specialized equipment.

                <p>A tree-sap like extract is hard on equipment with moving parts. Depending on the ambient temperature the extract can be as hard as glass or as liquid as oil. This adds unwanted complexity to the equipment – it will need complex heating systems to keep the extract flowing. The sticky aspect adds extract strain to the machine also.
                Powder imparts almost no wear onto the equipment, and powder is one of the most ideal ingredient forms available today in regards to equipment regardless of industry.
